# Generating Environments for MuJoCo ROS package

The `generate_model_env.py` file in this folder is used to generate `.mjb` files which when used in conjunction with [mujoco_ros](https://github.com/peterdavidfagan/mujoco_ros) enables interfacing with the same simulation instance with ROS 2 infrastructure.
